# IDEAS


## Principles
1. The LLM understands language
2. Euclid performs inference
3. Euclid IR is backend-independent
4. The backend is replaceable
5. Every answer must be verifiable
6. Proofs are first-class outputs

## Current tools
- `reason` — main deduction with proof trees
- `explain` — readable reasoning steps derived from the proof tree
- `diagnose` — query analysis (why/why_not/what_needs)
- `what_if` — scenario testing with fact additions/removals
- `check_kb` — knowledge base validation
- `register_kb` — register a named KB under a `kb_id`
- `unregister_kb` — remove a named KB from the registry
- `list_kbs` — list registered named KBs (metadata)

## Deployment
- Docker image (`swipl:stable` base) — MCP stdio + HTTP API modes
- Native-only slim image (`Dockerfile.native`, `python:3.12-slim`) — pure-Python engine, no SWI-Prolog installed
- Production reference: `docs/PRODUCTION.md` (stateless replicas behind HAProxy); monitoring stack in `monitoring/` (Prometheus + Grafana + cAdvisor)
- Tooling: `euclid-cli` (subcommands + interactive Euclid-IR REPL), `euclid-lsp/` (Language Server for Euclid-IR)


## NON GOALs
Euclid is not trying to:
- replace LLMs
- become a Prolog implementation
- become a planner
- become a knowledge graph
- become a vector database
- compete with RAG
- understand natural language


## Future ideas

The following ideas are not approved and maybe they will not be implemented

### Security (from 2026-08-12 hardening review)

- **Structural allowlist validation (post-parse)**: after translating a KB,
  validate that every predicate/arg conforms to the Euclid-IR grammar
  (predicates `\p{L}\w*`, args = atom/variable/number/string, only supported
  operators). Makes the contract explicit instead of relying on the blacklist;
  the blacklist stays as an early-reject/UX layer, not the security boundary.

### Backend

- Z3
- Soufflé
- ASP
- **Custom engine (SWI-Euclid)**: a self-contained Prolog engine embedded in the
  Euclid-MCP process (compile or distribute the SWI-Prolog runtime) for
  full-fidelity Prolog workloads. The pure-Python **native engine** (v0.4.0,
  see `docs/NATIVE_ENGINE.md`) already removes the external `swipl` dependency
  for small knowledge bases; SWI-Euclid would extend that to large KBs.

### Performance

- **Conditional load (skip shipping clauses on unchanged KB)**: v0.3.1 already
  skips the workspace rebuild for repeated KBs, but the Python side still
  serializes the full clause text over the pipe (~17.8 ms at 20 000 facts). A
  two-phase exchange — send only the fingerprint, let the engine ask for the
  clauses only on mismatch — would cut the unchanged-KB case to ~1 ms.

### Scaling & parallelism

- **In-process engine pool**: run N persistent engines per instance and dispatch
  each request to an idle one (round-robin), enabling concurrent requests on a
  single process / HTTP API without cross-process coordination.
  I'm not sure it is a good idea...
- **Threaded HTTP API**: serve parallel requests via `ThreadingHTTPServer` so one
  instance can translate a new request while the engine works on another.
- **Horizontal scale-out**: stateless replicas behind a load balancer — no session
  affinity, any instance serves any request (see README "Scalability").
  Documented for HAProxy in `docs/PRODUCTION.md`; nginx / Kubernetes reference
  docs are still open.

### Knowledge

- Knowledge compiler
- RAG compiler

### Explainability

- Graphviz proof tree
- HTML / localized explanations — the typed `structured_steps` shipped in
  v0.4.0 (`kind`/`goal`/`rule_id`/`body`) are the intended rendering source,
  so a UI no longer re-walks proof trees; what remains open is the actual
  renderer (HTML/SVG front end)

### IR

It is important to keep Euclid-IR as simple as possible... 

- Typed predicates
- Temporal predicates
- **Schema / arity declarations** — `@predicate has_role(person, role)`; validator
  checks arity/args against the schema and gives the LLM a clear "contract" of
  available predicates (check_kb already collects arities internally and flags
  inconsistent arities as a warning)
- **`@use "kb_name"`** — reference a pre-loaded named KB from within Euclid-IR
  (`kb_id` + `delta_knowledge` already ship the session overlay; `@use` would be
  its in-IR counterpart)
- **Namespaces** — `rbac.user(alice)` to avoid collisions in large KBs
- **Metadata** — `@title`, `@description`, `@author`, `@domain` (enterprise)
- **Execution directives** — `@engine prolog`, `@max_depth 30`,
  `@max_solutions 10`, `@proof full` (metadata, not facts)
- **Aggregations COUNT/SUM** — DEFERRED (scope risk: violates "Euclid-IR must not
  become another Prolog"; tracked here so it stays a conscious rejection)

### Positioning & docs

Recovered from the Jul 2026 external review when its section was removed:

- **Confidence split (translation vs inference)** — make explicit in docs and
  tool output which part of an answer comes from the LLM translation step and
  which from deterministic inference (MEDIUM)
- Rename README section "Why External Inference?" (LOW, cosmetic)

## Euclid-IR Language Evolution - Design philosophy

Euclid-IR is intentionally **not** a simplified Prolog.

It is a backend-independent intermediate representation designed for:

- Humans
- LLMs
- Deterministic inference engines

The language should describe **knowledge**, never **inference strategy**.

Whenever possible, complexity belongs in the translator or the backend, not in Euclid-IR itself.

## Language principles

Prefer modern conventions over historical Prolog syntax.

Examples:

| Euclid-IR | Instead of |
|-----------|------------|
| `$user` | `User` |
| `IF` | `:-` |
| `AND` | `,` |
| `NOT` | `\+` |
| `# comment` | `% comment` |

The language should feel natural to developers familiar with Markdown, YAML and modern programming languages.

## Documentation

`#` is the preferred comment syntax.

Comments may also be used as Markdown headings to organize knowledge bases.

Example:

```text
# Users

user(alice)

# Roles

has_role(alice, admin)
```

## Language future evolution

Future features should satisfy at least one of these goals:

- simplify LLM generation
- improve readability
- improve auditability
- remain backend-independent

Features that mainly expose backend-specific behavior should generally be avoided.
Backward compatibility should be maintaned when possible.

**"Euclid-IR should remain as simple as possible for reliable logical reasoning, but no simpler ."**
